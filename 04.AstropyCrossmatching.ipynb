The implementation of crossmatching in `astropy` constructs a k-d tree out of the second catalogue. This structure lets search through to efficiently find a match for each object in the first catalogue. The construction of a k-d tree is similar to the binary search described in this lesson. In this case, the k-dimensional (2-dimensiona) space is divided into two parts recursively until each division only contains only a single object. The results is the structure called a k-d tree which will look as\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<br>\n","<center>\n","<a href=\"https://ibb.co/t4vs3Rf\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/L8ctvKw/kdTree.png\" alt=\"kdTree\" border=\"0\"></a>\n","</center>\n","\n","Note that each cell contains only one element of the second catalogue (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I).\n","\n","In our particular example, the procedure (based on right ascension and declination) is as follows\n","\n","1.
