Improving Crossmatching\n","### About this notebook\n","\n","In this worksheet we present some ideas to improve the crossmatching algorithm.\n","\n","---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Y85Y_aIb8meo"},"source":["You may have noticed that the algorithm for crossmatching that we introduce in the class takes a long time, even with the cut down catalogues that we use.\n","\n","The crossmatcher takes every object in the BSS catalogue (320 objects) to calculate the distance to every object in SuperCOSMOS catalogue (500 objects). Then it requires 320 × 500 = 160000 distance calculations!\n","\n","The algorithm requires some seconds (or minutes) to complete the crossmatch between these two catalogues. However, if we want to use the full SuperCOSMOS catalogue (with more than 126 million objects), the comutation time will be over 250,000 times larger!! \n","\n","Considering even larger catalogues might take days, months or years to complete.

In the crossmatcher algorithm, it was necessary to transform the Right Acsension and the Declination of each object from degrees to radians in order to calculate the trigonometric functions. This conversion occurred in the angular distance calculation function, and therefore the coordinates of each object are converted many times (each time the funcion is called).\n","\n","Then, the first improvment to the algorithm is to modify the crossmatcher  so that the conversion of coordinates occurs only once.\n","\n","**Exercises**\n","\n","1. Improve the crossmatch algorithm for two catalogues by defining a function that\n","converts all the coordinates to radians before it starts the crossmatching. \n","\n","2. The complete algorithm for crossmatching should return 3 values:\n","\n","* A list of tuples of matched IDs and their distance in degrees.\n","\n","* A list of unmatched IDs from the first catalogue\n","\n","* The time taken (in seconds) to run the crossmatcher.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uH_BkxpRI5CY"},"source":["#### `Numpy` Calculations\n","\n","The catalogues used in this lesson are given as a 3xN NumPy array of floats.

Hence, it is possible to stop the loop when the declination of the object in the second catalogue exceeds the target declination by the defined maximum radius.\n","\n","If the first catalogue object (the target) has a declination of $\\delta_1$ and the maximum radius is defined as $r$, we can proceed as follows,\n","\n","1. Sort the second catalogue objects by order of declination\n","\n","2. Start the search loop at the first object, in the second catalogue, with declination greater than $\\delta_1 - r$\n","\n","3. Stop the search loop at the last object, in the second catalogue, with declination less than $\\delta_1 +r$.\n","\n","It is clear that these restrictions will improve the time spend in distance calculations. However, a question that arises is, how can we find the objects in the second catalogue nearest to the boundaries of the interval $[\\delta_1-r, \\delta+r]$ ?\n","\n","Obiously, the easiest way to do this  is to loop through the sorted catalogue, checking every declination until we find the objects we're looking for. \n","\n","**Exercises**\n","\n","1.
